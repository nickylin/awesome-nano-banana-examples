*Here we display some of the most stunning and representative images to attract visitors with a strong visual impact.*

| Category | Prompt | Output | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Character Figure** | `turn this photo into a character figure. Behind it, place a box with the character‚Äôs image printed on it, and a computer showing the Blender modeling process on its screen. In front of the box, add a round plastic base with the character figure standing on it. Make the PVC material look clear, and set the scene indoors if possible.` | ![alt text](images/image-15.png) ![alt text](images/image-14.png) | [Xilisen] |
| **Product Rendering** | `A model is posing and leaning against a pink bmw. She is wearing the following items, the scene is against a light grey background. The green alien is a keychain and it's attached to the pink handbag. The model also has a pink parrot on her shoulder. There is a pug sitting next to her wearing a pink collar and gold headphones.` | ![alt text](images/image-16.png) ![alt text](images/image-17.png) | [ravis Davids] |

## üí° Application Scenarios

**1. Combine photos into new scenes**
   - **Description**: Seamlessly merge multiple independent photos into a brand new, imaginative scene. For example, you can combine a photo of your friend with a photo of the moon's surface to generate an image of "a friend walking on the moon." The model will automatically handle lighting, shadows, and perspective to make the result look seamless.

**2. Edit image by describing to it**
   - **Description**: Use natural language to directly "command" the model to modify an image. No need for complex photo editing software; just tell it "put sunglasses on this girl" or "change the sky to the style of Van Gogh's Starry Night," and the model will understand and execute your instructions.

**3. AI Video Stream (Nano Banana + Runway Act 2)**
   - **Description**: This is a powerful workflow. First, use Nano Banana to generate a high-quality static image (e.g., a keyframe of a futuristic city), then import it into a video generation tool like Runway Act 2 to bring the static image to life, greatly simplifying the animation and video creation process.

**4. Start frames for Ads**
   - **Description**: Quickly generate a large number of "starting frames" or "concept images" in different styles and with different creative ideas in the early stages of ad production. This helps creative teams visualize ideas in minutes for proposals and selection, greatly improving efficiency.

**5. Move styles from one image to another**
   - **Description**: Apply the artistic style of one image (e.g., watercolor, oil painting, cyberpunk) to the content of another. You can easily turn an ordinary street scene photo into a masterpiece full of artistic sense.

**6. Change text**
   - **Description**: Intelligently recognize and modify the text content in an image. For example, you can easily change "Summer Sale" on a poster to "Autumn New Arrivals," and the model will automatically match the original font, color, and lighting effects.

**7. Restore or fix old and blurry photos**
   - **Description**: Repair old photos that are scratched, blurry, or have low resolution. The model can intelligently "imagine" the missing details, improve clarity, and even colorize black and white photos, bringing precious memories back to life.

**8. Change image background**
   - **Description**: Easily change the background of any image's subject. Whether it's changing the background color for an ID photo or generating diverse display environments for product images, it can be done with one click, and the edges are handled very naturally.

**9. A new era of indie anime animators**
   - **Description**: Empower independent animation and manga creators. By generating character designs, scene concept art, keyframe animations, etc., it greatly reduces the barrier to entry and cost of creation, allowing a single person or a small team to create high-quality anime works.

**10. Create new images in the same style from a reference photo**
    - **Description**: Provide a reference image and let the model "learn" its unique style (including art style, color tone, brushstrokes, etc.), then use this style to generate brand new images with different content. This is crucial for creating series of illustrations, game assets, or maintaining brand visual consistency.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

There are two main ways to experience the power of Gemini-Nano-Banana:

### 1. Gemini AI Studio (Chatbox)

This is the easiest and fastest way, requiring no programming knowledge.

- **Entry**: Visit [Gemini AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
- **Steps**:
  1. Directly enter your image generation instructions (Prompt) in the chatbox.
  2. You can also upload an image and then enter instructions to have the model edit or transform the image.
  3. Click generate to see the results on the right side of the interface.
